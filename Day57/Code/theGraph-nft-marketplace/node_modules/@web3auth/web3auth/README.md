> Web3Auth is where passwordless auth meets non-custodial key infrastructure for Web3 apps and wallets. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets and innovative Multi Party Computation (MPC) - Web3Auth provides a seamless login experience to every user on your application.

This package provides main class for using default Web3Auth Modal. The package includes all of our packages and gives you a simple way of implementing Web3Auth within your interface. Additionally, it is a child class of [`@web3auth/core`](https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/core/) package. Hence, you can still call all the functions available in the [`@web3auth/core`](https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/core/) package.

### Get your Client ID from Web3Auth Dashboard

Hop on to the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) and create a new project. Use the Client ID of the project to start your integration.

### Initialize Web3Auth for your preferred blockchain

Web3Auth needs to initialise as soon as your app loads up to enable the user to log in. Preferably done within a constructor, initialisation is the step where you can pass on all the configurations for Web3Auth you want. A simple integration for Ethereum blockchain will look like this:

```js
import { Web3Auth } from "@web3auth/web3auth";

//Initialize within your constructor
const web3auth = new Web3Auth({
  clientId: "", // Get your Client ID from Web3Auth Dashboard
  chainConfig: {
    chainNamespace: "eip155",
    chainId: "0x1",
  },
});

await web3auth.initModal();
```

### Login your User

Once you're done initialising, just create a button that triggers to open the login modal for the user on their request. Logging in is as easy as:

```js
await web3auth.connect();
```
