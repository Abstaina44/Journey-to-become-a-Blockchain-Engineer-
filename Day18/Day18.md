## NFTs

NFTs are hot right right now.NFTs also known as `ERC-721s` are a token standard that was created on the Ethereum platform.NFT stands for `Non-Fungible Token` and is a token standard similar to ERC20.Again ERC20s like LINK, AAVE, MAKER all those goodies that are found on the Ethereum chain.An NFT is a token that is non-fungible.This means that they are starkly unique from eachother and one token isn't interchangeable with any of the token of it's class.A good way to think about is one dollar is interchangeable with any other dollar.One dollar is going to have the same value of another dollar.Those are fungible tokens.That's like ERC20s(Technically ERC677).One LINK is always going to be equivalent to one other LINK.

By contrast is going to be NFTs like Pokemon.Your one pokemon is going to have different stats, different move sets and isn't interchangeable with any other pokemon or more relatable is unique piece of art like Picasso.That's what these NFTs are.They are non-fungible, non-interchangeable tokens that for the moment are best represented or thought about as digital pieces of art that are incorruptable and have a permanent history who's owned them, deployed them etc.

Now like I said NTFs are just a token standard.You can actually do them much more than just be art.You can give them stats.You can make them battle.You can do really unique things with them.You can do pretty much whatever you want with them but right now the easiest way to think about it and the most popular way is by calling them art or some type of collectible or just anything that's unique.

They've been getting ton of buzz recently because we've been seening more and more these being sold at insane prices like we saw AXIE INFINITY sold nine plots of their unique land for $1.5 million.We also saw the original creator of the NEON CAT sold for like 300 ETH.Like I said they're just tokens that are deployed on a smart contract platform and you can view them on different NFT platforms like [opensea](https://opensea.io/).This is the NFT marketplace that let people buy and sell them.You obviously can do that without the marketplaces because it's a decentralized but they help and give a good UI.So that's the basic gist of it.


**ERC-721**

The ERC-721 standard or the NFT standard this is the basis of it all.There's another standard that's semi-fungible tokens the `ERC-1155`.We're not gonna talk about that here but you can check it out.The main differences between a 721 and ERC20 are ERC20s have a real simple mapping between address and how much that address holds.

![ERC20Mapping](Images/l1.png)

721 has unique token ids.Each token id has a unique owner.

![721Mapping](Images/l2.png)

In addition they've what's called a token URI which we'll talk about in a minute.

![TokenURI](Images/l3.png)

Each token is unique.Each token id represents a unique asset.So since these assets are unique, we want to be able to visualize them and show what they look like.We need to define those attributes of the object.If it's a piece of art, we need to define a way to define what that art looks like.If it's some type of character in game, we need a way to define that character's stats in the NFT.

**Metadata**

This is where metadata and token URI come in.So if you know anything about ethereum, you know that sometimes gas prices gets pretty high.Especially when it comes to storing a lot of space, it can get really really expensive.So one of your first question might be "Are they storing these images and these art pieces on chain?" and the answer is sometimes.Back when they're coming up with NFTs and artists were deploying stuff, the ETH devs and the artists realize that if they put all this art on chain it's gonna be incredibly expensive.So to get around this what they did put in the standard what's called the token uri.


**Token URI**

Token URI is a universally unique indicator of what that asset or what that token looks like and what the attributes of the token are.You can use something like a centralized API or IPFS to actually get the token URI.A token URI is just a simple API call.

Typical token URI has to return something in the below image format.It has name, image location, desription and any attributes below.The image URI is a seperate URL that points to an image.

![TokenURIReturnFormat](Images/l4.png)

Your first question probably be "We pull from a single source seems pretty centralized"This is the current limitation of the NFT ecosystem.There's often this talk of on-chain metadata vs off-chain metadata because it's so much easier and cheaper to store all your metadata off-chain.A lot of people use something like `IPFS` that is decentralized but does take a little bit of centrality to keep persisting but they can also use their own centralized API.However if that goes down then you loose your image you loose everything associated with your NFT.Because of this most NFT marketplaces actually can't and won't read off on-chain attributes or on-chain metadata because they're so used to looking for the token uri.

Obviously if you do off-chain metadata, you can't do anything really cool or interesting or have any games with your NFTs.For example if you wanted to create an on-chain pokemon game, all your attributes would need to be on-chain in order for your pokemon to interact with eachother because if it was off chain then that becomes alot harder to cryptographically prove.So if you're new with NFT and you're like "wait this is kind of like lots of information", I'll make it easier for you.

IF you're looking to render an image of an NfT
- add your image to IPFS
- add a metadata file(token URI json) pointing to that image file on IPFS
- then grab that token URI and put it and set it as your NFT

The [chainlink dnd article](https://blog.chain.link/build-deploy-and-sell-your-own-dynamic-nft/) does a great job of walking you through this and showing you how to do this.Be sure to read that if you're looking to learn how to do that.


**Let's start coding**

There are two different types of contracts that we're going to be working with.We're gonna be first working with a simple collectible and then we're gonna work with an advanced collectible.The simple collectible is going to be a very simple ERC721 standard.We're not gonna really add any bells and whistles other than give it like a name.Then our advanced collectible is going to take advantage of some of those more advanced true scarcity features that we're talking about.So protocols like avagochi and ethercards use chainlink vrf to get verifiably random numbers to create verifiably scarce nfts.Something that's important to keep in mind is that `in the real world when companies create trading cards there's no way to prove how scarce or how valuable these trading cards actually are.If we use a verifiable random number then whoever is deploying these NFTs can't even control how rare there NFTs really are`.So we get this scarcity and rarity which adds some value to the tokens.

If you want to just go ahead and work right from the brownie-mix you can absolutely just run `brownie bake nft-mix`.We're gonna go through and deploy and develop everything from scratch because we're gonna actually take some previous concepts that we've learned, improve on them and we're gonna learn alot of nitty gritty interesting pieces about making this hybrid smart contract because these NFTs really are a perfect example of a hybrid smart contract.They've some off-chain component interaction with a random number and restoring their metadata with IPFS and I'll explain IPFS a little bit more in depth as we go on.

**Initial Setup**

So let's go ahead and get to it.I'm gonna go ahead and make a new directory called NFT and open the folder in VS code.First step we're gonna do is `brownie init` to create our blank brownie repository.

**SimpleCollectible.sol**

Let's go ahead and create our first contract.We'll call this SimpleCollectible.sol.Since this is going to be a simple collectible a simple NFT that we're gonna get started with.Now similar to ERC20, this [ERC721 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) has a nummber of functions that we can actually work with.

![ERC721](Images/l5.png)

Once again instead of us kind of recoding copy pasting all this from scratch we're gonna be using open zeppelin's ERC721 [documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721) for this.We're gonna be working with version 3.x.There's a version 4.x that has come out.Using version 3.x of their open zeppelin contracts is also a little bit easier to explain but again those who want to challenge yourself definitely try their 4.x version.So let's go ahead and jump right into it.

First we'll SPDX license identifier then we'll choose our solidity version.Then we're gonna go ahead and look at the open zeppelin ERC721 documentation and we're gonna go ahead and grab importing ERC21 line.

`import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";`

You're can even see a sample ERC721 that they give you and it's going to be similar to the ERC721 that we're gonna make.We go ahead and paste that line in our code and ofcourse since we're doing @openzeppelin/contracts, we're gonna need to create our brownie config and same as always we'll add dependencies.

![AddingDependencies](Images/l6.png)

Let's even try to just compile this right now.

`brownie compile`

Similarly to our ERC20 that we did with open zeppelin, we're gonna do the same startup here.

![Inheriting](Images/l7.png)

This is how we're going to inherit all of those functions in the ERC721 token standard here and we can start coding our simple ERC721.Now for our ERC721, we're gonna make it be a couple of cute adorable cats.You can use any image that you want for this course however if you wanna follow along with me, you can download the image, create folder inside your NTF directory called img and add that image to that folder.The image is going to be the NFT that we're gonna deploy.We're gonna deploy very simple cat for our smart contract.Let's go ahead and create the rest of the contract for the image.

First thing we're gonna make is our constructor, it's going to take no input parameters which is going to be a public constructor and then we're gonna go ahead and use the ERC721 constructor which if we look at the documentation we give it a name and then a symbol.We're gonna use the ERC721 constructor parameters which is gonna to name which we're gonna say is Chase and symbol is CHA.

![constructor](Images/l8.png)

That's all we really need to do for the first part.

**Factory Contract**

This NFT contract is actually what's known as a `factory contract`.There's a main contract and in it, it has a list of all the NFTs and the owners that are of this type of NFT.So in this example all the type of NFT is just gonna be this cat and we actually need a function to mint new NFTs based off of this cat.Now we can absolutely have an NFT factory contract that only creates one single NFT but we're gonna use this factory implementation to create multiple NFTs.

This is different "factory" pattern than what we did with SimpleStorage.We make many NFTs, but they are all contained in this one contract.We're gonna do it with a function called "createCollectible".This will create a new NFT and assign it to whoever called this function.So anybody can come here and create a new cat for themselves or in other words adopt a cat.

![createCollectibleDefinition](Images/l9.png)

When we create this collectible all we're going is we're assigning a new token id to a new owner and if we look at the [open zeppelin ERC721 github](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol), we can see they've _safeMint function.

![SafeMint](Images/l10.png)

**_safeMint**

This is the function that they use to mint or create a new NFT.This function takes a new address to which is going to be the new owner of the NFT and a token id.Every NFT in this factory contract has a unique token id.We're gonna have our token ids start from 0 and just increment every time we have a new token minted.

![AnotherSafeMint](Images/l11.png)

This _safeMint function called another _safeMint function which calls _mint function.So if you're looking at the code, the _mint function is really the function that calls and creates the NFT.You'll see actually they just have two mappings that they update.

![Mint](Images/l12.png)

They update this owner's mapping which is just the mapping of token ids to the owners of the token ids and then they update the balances which is a mapping of owner address to the token count.So the number of tokens that an owner actually has and that's all that's happening when we call this _mint or in our case _safeMint function.

The difference between _safeMint and _mint is _safeMint checks to see if a token id has already been used or not and this way we don't actually override who owns tokens and who owns token ids.So we're going to be using the _safeMint function.

So first we're gonna need a way to count these token ids.So that every single person has a unique token id.Let's create a global variable tokenCounter and we initialize it to zero.

![tokenCounter](Images/l13.png)

When we create a new collectible, we're gonna say it's id to be tokenCounter and iterate tokenCounter every time we mint a new token.

![newTokenID](Images/l14.png)

We're gonna call the _safeMint function since we're inheriting it from open zeppelin's ERC721.We need to give this _safeMint function a new NFT and owner.

![CallingSafeMint](Images/l15.png)

Whenever we mint one we're gonna want to increment the tokenCounter and return the token ID.

![completeFunction](Images/l16.png)

We'll return the token ID of the token that we just created.If you're looking for incredibly minimalistic contract to deploy NFTs this is all that you need.We can run `brownie compile` to make sure we did everything right.

Obviously this might be a little dissatisfying to you after the breakdown that we just gave.

**How do I "see" the NFT?**

How do we view this token? What does this token looks like? I though we wanted this to be a cat.How do we know that this looks like a cat? How do we get the image on the blockchain? This is where `metadata` is going to come into play.If we look at the original [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) there's this part called `"The metadata extension is optional for ERC721 smart contracts."`As we've talked about anytime you make a transaction on chain, it costs some gas.Even very tiny amounts of data can cost more and more gas.Images are much bigger then the data(the code we just wrote) and they can cost lot more gas.So when this standard was being created, the developers kept this in mind and knew that storing entire images and entire gifs and entire videos on chain was gonna be incredibly costly.So they added the piece about metedatas and token URIs.

A token URI is a distinct uniform resource identifier for a given asset.URI is just a unique resource identifier.So this can be something like https or ipfs or any url string that uniquely points to some metadata.Your metadata file is gonna look like this.

![metadata](Images/l17.png)

It's gonna have a title for the title of the NFT, can have a type and it can have all the different properties or stats or attributes.For example we're gonna have our cat NFT which is defined like name as chase, description can be adorable cutie cat and it's gonna have the image uri which defines what the token actually looks like and if we copy past the uri into another browser, we get our image.It's the token uri with the metadata json object that's going to enable different NFT platforms to actually render our NFT.Platform like opensea undestands that they need to show the image, use the name, description and have the traits.

**Is this decentralized?**

This ofcourse leads us to a really interesting point.If we're storing the image off chain then how is the image decentralized?If we're storing the image off-chain how can we guarantee the NFT is gonna stay forever?

**Ethereum Size and dStorage**

Now this leads us into a little bit about storing data on blockchain.As of current time storing a lot of data on-chain can get incredibly expensive.The more data that you store,the more transactions that you have to make to store that data on-chain and the more gas that you're going to spend.At this time [Ethereum](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_chain_full_sync_data_size) is about little less than 670 GB in size.If a ton of people were to put full videos or movies or massive images Ethereum will grow exponentially out of proportion and this would become unsustainable for blockchain network as a whole.So Ethereum isn't great for actually storing a ton of data.It can store alot of data but it's lot better for doing the logic and smart contracts.

So there're alot of different platforms that are actually working on this `problem of storage`.These platforms allow people to store data in a decentralized way that isn't going to exponentially explode the size of ethereum or different smart contract platforms.

**IPFS**

The decentralized storage methodology that we're gonna work with is going to be IPFs or Interplanatery File System.This is where we're actually going to store our image so that NFT marketplaces know what our NFT looks like.Now here's what some protocols do.Some protocols just set up a server and set the token uri to instead be from a decentralized service like IPFS and use maybe their own centralized sever.This is obviously a massive issue because if their server goes down or if they wanna change the image or they want to change the stats, all they have to do is change in their server.This is why a protocol like IPFS is going to be alot easier, quicker and more decentralized version of doing this.

The full solution is going to be using something with IPFS and `Filecoin` but easy solutions to do that are still being built out so for now we're just going to use IPFS because it's free, quick, easy and can be expanded to combine with Filecoin to be even easier to work with.

We can modify the setup to be more decentralized later.

Now something else I wanna touch on too.When it comes to metadata, right now all these NFT marketplaces only know how to pull attributes from the token URI.If we wanna build really cool NFTs that can interact with eachother, having some attributes or maybe some like attack stats or attack moves like in Pokemon for example or trading cards, we can't just store these in the token URI because the blockchain doesn't know anything about the token URI.So we actually need to store attributes on-chain.I'm really hoping in the future alot of the NFT marketplaces are gonna get better at pulling metadata from on-chain but right now any attribute that we give our NFTs. we actually have to reproduce in the token metadata and the token URI as well.

So we've just learned alot about metadata, IPFS, token URIS and everything like that.Let's update the simple NFT to be able to render on opensea and render on these NFT platforms because right now if we deploy the code nobody would know what this cat looks like.Let's give it a token URI.

![tokenURI](Images/l18.png)

We set the token URI for the tokenID and give it a token URI.This will allow our NFT to actually have an image associated with it that we can actually see.

**deploy_and_create.py**

So let's go ahead and create a script that's going to deploy NFT factory contract and then create us a collectible.We're gonna do a new file in scripts and name it "deploy_and_create.py".

First we need to start with an account.

![account](Images/l19.png)

Once again we can go ahead and create helpful_Scripts.py.

![helpful_scripts](Images/l20.png)

But ofcourse since we've this config["wallets"]["from_key"], we're gonna go to our brownie-config and add wallet.

![wallet](Images/l21.png)

Since we're using a private key again we're gonna create a .env and export our private key and infura project ID.

And we'll add new file "__init__.py" so that older versions of python know that this is indeed a package.

So we'll import get_accounts function and also SimpleCollectible.

![deployingSC](Images/l22.png)

This will have our SimpleCollectible deployed.Now we need to actually call createCollectible function and we're gonna pass it a string which is going to be a token URI.

 ![tokenURI](Images/l23.png)
 
 **IPFS companion**
 
 When you paste your token URI in your browser, if you can't see it you might have to add something like [IPFS companion](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ipfs-companion/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search)(For Firefox) to your browser.Some browser don't natively have it.
 
 Now that we've a token URI, we can call createCollectible function.
 
 ![CallingCreateCollectible](Images/l24.png)
 
 If we've done this correctly we'll actually be able to see this NFT on an NFT marketplace like opensea.
 
 **Testing**
 
 No project is complete without some tests.So let's create some tests.Since we're also gonna be doing an advanced collectible I'm going to skip the integration test and I'm just gonna write a really simple unit test.So we'll create a folder we'll call unit and in there we'll create a new file called "test_simple_collectible.py".
 
 ![testing](Images/l25.png)
 
 Something that we can do here is in our test we can go ahead and even test our scripts by importing deploy_and_create and testing main function.This we do by first returning simple_Collectible.
 
 ![returning](Images/l26.png)
 
 And in our test that we could do :
 
 ![importingDeploynCreate](Images/l27.png)
 
 and back in our deploy_and_create script we can modify this a little bit.Instead of main we'll call deploy_and_create and then we'll have our main function and call deploy_and_create.
 
  ![modifyingDeploynCreate](Images/l28.png)
  
  Let's run real quick on the development network to check it's working fine.
  
  `brownie run scripts/deploy_and_create.py`
  
  Obviously we won't actually be able to see our NFT on opensea because this is deployed to the brownie temporary ganache chain as opposed to a persistent rinkeby chain.
  
  In our test here we could then just do.
  
  ![firstAssert](Images/l29.png)
  
  ![firstAssertOutput](Images/l30.png)
  
  **What else with NFTs?**
  
  This was all fun and dandy but there's couple of things that we didn't go over and that we didn't do.So let's create a quick README.md for a couple of notes.
  
  ![readme](Images/l31.png)
  
  We want to build an NFT project that has all these pieces.We're gonna talk a little bit more about why IPFS is decentralized and it's the perferred solution for storing NFT metadata and we're gonna make our NFT more verifiably random and verifiably scarce like for things like ethercards and avagochi.
