## Upgrades

When deploying your smart contracts on-chain, we all know that those smart contracts are immutable or unchangeable but what if I told you that they were mutable? Well technically I wouldn't be correct however smart contracts actually can change all the time.When people transfer tokens, when people stake in a contract or really do any type of functionality those smart contracts have to update their balances and update their mappings and their variables to reflect this.The reason that they're immutable is that the logic itself never changes and will be on-chain like that forever.So technically once they're deployed they're immutable and this is actually one of the major benefits of smart contracts in the first place that nobody can tamper with or screw with our smart contracts once we deploy them.

However this can be an issue if for example we want it to updrage our smart contract protocol to so more things or we want to fix some glaring bug or issue that we have.Now even though we can't change the specific code that's been deployed to an address, we can actually do alot more than you think.We're going to explain the different methodologies behind upgrading your smart contracts and then we're going to show you how to do it.

Now at first glance you might be thinking "If you can upgrade your smart contracts then they're not really immutable".In a way you'd be right.So when explaining kind of different philosophies and patterns that we can use here we don't need to keep in mind the philosophies and decentralization implications that each one of these patterns have as they do all have different advantages and disadvantages and yes some of the disadvantages here are going to affect decentrality.So we need to keep that in mind and this is why it's so important that before you go ahead and jump in and start deploying upgradable smart contracts you understand the trade-offs.We're going to look at three different ways to upgrade your smart contracts.
- Not Really / Parameterize
- Social YEET / Migration
- Proxies

**Not Really / Parameterize**

So let's talk about the not really upgrading method or the parameterization method.This is the simplest way to think about upgrading your smart contracts and it really isn't upgrading your smart contracts because we can't really change the logic of the smart contract.Whatever logic that we've written is there.We also can't add new storage or state variables so this is not really upgrading but it is something to think about.Upgrades is just parameterizing everything.Whatever logic that we've deployed is there and that's what we're interacting with.
- Can't add new storage
- Can't add new logic

![setReward](Images/m1.png)

This function means that we've just a whole bunch of setter functions and we can update certain parameters like maybe we've a reward parameter that gives out a token at 1% every year or something like that.Maybe we've a setter function that says to update to 2%, just a setter function that changes some variables.Now the advantages here are obviously this is really simple to implement.The disadvantage is that if you didn't think of some logic or some functionality the first time you deployed their smart contract, that's too bad you're stuck with it.You can't update the logic or really update anything with the parameterization aka not really method.
- Simple but not flexible

**Who the admins?**

The other thing you have to think about is who the admins are? Who has access to these setter functions to these updating functions.If it's a single person  guess what you've a centralized smart contract.Now of course you can add a governance contract to be the admin contract of your protocol and that would be a decentralized way of doing this.So keep that in mind.You can do this method, just need a governance protocol to do so.

Another example of this might be a contract registry and this is actually something actually early versions of Aave used.Before you call function, you actually check some contract registry that is updated as a parameter by somebody and you get routed to that contract and you do your call there.Again this really doesn't allow us to have the full functionality of upgrades here.You can argue that this registry is a mix of one of the later versions but for all intents and purposes this deesn't really give us that flexibility we want for our upgrades.

**Are upgradeable smart contracts decentralized?**

But some people might think that upgrading your smart contract is ruining the decentrality and one of the things that makes smart contracts so potent is that they're immutable and this is one of the benefits they've.So there're some people who think that you shouldn't add any customization or any upgradability you should deploy your contract and then that's it.Trail of Bits has actually argued that if you deploy your contract knowing that it can't be changed later.You take a little bit extra time making sure you get everything right and there're often less security vulnerabilities because you're just setting it for getting it and not looking it again.

Now if I were to deploy a smart contract and I wanted to upgrade it with this philosophy in mind that we got to keep it immutable, we could use the social yeet method to actually upgrade to new versions.

**Social YEET / Migration**

The social yeet method or the migration method is just when you deploy your new contract not connected to the old contract in any way and by social convention you tell everybody "Hey new contract we just deployed and this is the real one now".It's just by convention of people migrating and over into using this new one that the upgrade is donce.

![aave](Images/m2.png)

This has the advantage of truly always saying "This is our immutable smart contract and this is our new one".This is really truest definition of immutable because since you give it no way of being upgraded in place then if somebody calls that contract in 50000 years in the future, it'll respond exactly the same.

Pros:
- Truest to blockchain values
- Easiest to audit

Another huge disadvantage here is that you've a totally new contract address.So if you're an ERC20 token for example you've to go convince all the exchanges to list your new contract address as the actual address.Keep in mind that when we do this we do have to move this state of the first one over to the second one.So for example if you're an ERC20 token moving to a new version of that ERC token, you do have to have a way to take all those mappings from the first contract and move it to second one.Obviously there are ways to do this since everything is on-chain but if you have a million transfer calls I don't want to have to write the script that updates everyone's balance and figures out what everyone's balance is just so I can migrate to my new version of the contract.

Cons:
- Lot's of work to convince users to move
- Different addresses

So there's a ton of social convention work here to do.[Trail of bits](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/10/29/how-contract-migration-works/) has actually written a fantastic blog on upgrading from V1 to V2 or etc with this YEET methodology and they give lots of steps for moving your storage and your state variables over to the new contract.

So ir order to have a really robust upgrading mentality or philosophy, we need to have some type of methodology or framework that can update our state keep our contract address and allows us to update any type of logic in our smart contracts in an easy way which leads to our big ticked item ` the proxies`.

**Proxies**

Proxies are the truest from of programtic upgrades since a user can keep interacting with the protocols through these proxies and not even notice that anything changed or even got updated.Now these are also the places where you can screw up the easiest.

![proxy](Images/m3.png)

Proxies use a lot of low-level functionality and the main one being the `delegate call functionality`.Delegate call is a low level function where the code in the target contract is executed in the context of the calling contract and msg.sender and msg.value also don't change.

In English this means if I delegate call a function in contract B from contract A, I'll do contracts B's logic in contract A.

![delegateCall](Images/m4.png)

So if contract B has a function that says "Hey store this value in a variable up top", I'm going to store that variable in contract A.This is the powerhouse and this combined with the fallback function allows us to delegate all calls through a proxy contract address to some other contract.

![proxyWithFallBack](Images/m5.png)

This means that I can have one proxy contract that will have the same address forever and I can just point and route people to the correct implementation contract that has the logic.

![pointing](Images/m6.png)

Whenever I want to upgrade I just deploy a new implementation contract and point my proxy to that new implementation.Now whenever a user calls a function on the the proxy contract I'm going to delegate call it to the new contract.

![delegateCall](Images/m7.png)

I can just call an admin only function on my proxy contract.

![adminOnly](Images/m8.png)

I make all the contract calls go to this new contract.

When talking about proxies, there're four pieces of terminology that we want to keep in our mind.

1. The Implementation Contract
    - Which has all our code protocol.When we upgrade, we lunch a new brand new implementation code.
2. The proxy contract
    - Which points to which implementation is the "correct" one, and routes everyone's function calls to that contract.
    - You can think it sits on top of implementation contract.
3. The user
    - They make calls to the proxy.
4. The admin
    - This is the user (or group of users/voters) who upgrade to new implementation contracts.
    
In this scenario the other cool thing about the proxy and delegate call is that all my storage variables are going to be stored in the proxy contract and not in the implementation contract.This way when I upgrade to a new logic contract, all of my data will stay on the proxy contract.So whenever I wanna update my logic just point to a new implementation contract.If I want to add new storage variable or a new type of storage, I just add it in my logic contract and the proxy contract will pick it up.

![proxyPointing](Images/m9.png)

Now using proxies has couple of `gotchas` and we're going to talk about the gotchas and then we're going to talk about different proxy methodologies because there're many proxy contract methodologies as well and this is why `trail a bits` doesn't really recommend using upgradable proxies for your smart contracts because they're fraught with alot of these potential issues.Not to mention again you do still have some type of admin who's going to be upgrading your smart contracts.Now if this is a governance protocol then great you're decentralized but if this is a single group or entity then we've a problem.

**Biggest Gotchas**
- Storage Clashes
- Function Selector Clashes

When we use delegate call, remember we do the logic of contract B inside contract A.So if contract B says we need to set value to 2.We go ahead and set value to 2.

![delegateCall](Images/m10.png)

but these smart contracts are actually kind of dumb.we actually set the value of whatever is in the same storage location on contract A as contract B.So if our contract looks like above and we have to variables in contract A we're still gonna set the first storage spot on contract A to the new value.

![setFirstStorage](Images/m11.png)

This is really important to know because this means we can only append new storage variables in new implementation contracts and we can't reorder or change old ones.This is called `storage clashing` and in the implementation we're going to talk about they all address this issue.

The next one is called function selector clashes.When we tell our proxies to delegate call to one of these implementations, it uses what's called a `function selector` to find a function.The function selector is a `four byte hash` of the `function name` and the `function signature`.Don't worry about the function signature for now.Now it's possible that a function in the implementation contract has the same function selector as an admin function in the proxy contract which may cause you to do accidentally a whole bunch of weird stuff.

For example:

![example](Images/m12.png)

Even though these functions are totally different, they actually have the same function selector.So yes we can run into an issue where some harmless function like get price has the same function selector as upgrade proxy or destroy proxy.

This leads to our first out of the three implementations of the proxy contract.

**Transparent Proxy Pattern**

This is called the `Transparent Proxy Pattern` and this is actually going to be the pattern that we're going to be demoing to you.In this methodology admins are only allowed to call admin functions and they can't call any functions in the implementation contract.Users can only call functions in the implementation contract and not any admin contracts.This way you can't ever accidentally have one of the two swapping and having a function selector clash and you run into a big issue where you call a function, you shouldn't have.

If you're admin, you're calling admin functions.If you're user, you're calling implementation functions.So if you're an admin and you build some crazy defi protocol, you better come up with a new wallet address because you can't perticipate.

**Universal Upgradeable Proxies**

Second type of proxy we're going to talk about is the Universal Upgradeable Proxy or the UUPS.This version of upgradable contracts actually puts all the logic of upgrading in the implementation itself.This way the solidity compiler will actually kick out and say "Hey we got two functions in here that have the same function selector".

![sameFunctionSelector](Images/m13.png)

**Gas Saver!!**

This is also advantageous because we've one less read that we've to do.We no longer have to check in the proxy contract if someone is an admin or not.This saves on gas of course.

And the proxy is also a little-bit smaller because if this.The issue is that if you deploy an implementation contract without any upgradeable functionality, you're stuck and it's back to the yeet method with you.

**Diamond Pattern**

One of the biggest things that it does is it actually allows for multiple implementation contracts.This addresses a couple different issues.For example if your contract is so big and it doesn't fit into the one contract maximum size, you can just have multiple contracts through the multi-implementation method.

![diamondPattern](Images/m14.png)

It also allows you to make more granular upgrades like you don't have to always deploy and upgrade your entire smart contract, you can just upgrade little pieces of it if you've chucked them out.

The disadvantages here really only seem like you have alot more complicated code.

All the proxies mentioned here have some type of ethereum improvement prosopal and most of them are in the draft phase.There isn't really standard here for the proxy that the whole community has landed on and says "Yes this is great.Let's do it".So for all these be sure to jump on the discussion and give your thoughts.
